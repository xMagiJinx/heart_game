Here we are with a game for EW200 class

I plan on making a game that is a platform side scroller?
Based off of recent events, it would be something like avoiding
red flags and not getting your heart broken

Ideas include
- lofi music background
- heart breaking over time
- increasing the items you encounter as time goes on
- score based off of time still alive
-
